# English But Quicker
Basically a bunch of rules to make English a bit shorter, while still reading them the same way. This is meant for writing, specifically.
**Note: Please do not re-iterate rules (Run the rules over some text, and do it again on the modified text), it makes it confusing.**
Some words may be ambiguous alone, but, with context, the correct one should pop out.

* O's proceeding g's should turn into just the g.
  * Example: Eggnog -> Eggng
* Since all q's apparently have to follow with a u, drop the u's.
  * Example: Queen -> Qeen
    * **NOTE: MOST Q'S ARE FOLLOWED BY U'S, SO DO BE CAREFUL WITH SPECIFIC CHANCES**
* A's proceeding g's should become y's
  * Example: Bag -> By
* U's proceeding g's should become y's
  * Example: Bug -> By
* N's proceeding g's may become one character
  * Example: Singing -> Siŋiŋ
* A's may look like u's
  * Example: Bay -> Buy
* W's may look like u's
  * Example: Weather -> UUeather OR Ueather
* M's may look like n's
  * Example: Maple -> NNaple OR Naple
* U's proceeding y's should become y's
  * Example: Buy -> By

# Additional Extras
Some extra ones to simplify even more

* P's procreeding h's should become f's
  * Photography -> Fotografy
